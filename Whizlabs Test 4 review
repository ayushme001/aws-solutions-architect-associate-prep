This is a comprehensive review of the wrong answers that I got on test 4. This review will include the answers, why they're correct
and what could have been the reason behind them being wrong.



Question 1: You are hosting a web server on an EC2 Instance. With the number of requests consuming a large part of the CPU, 
the response performance for the application is getting degraded. Which of the following would help to alleviate the problem 
and provide a better response time?

Answer: Place a CloudFront distribution in front of the EC2 Instance.
Answer I chose: Place the EC2 instance behind the App Load balancer.
Reasoning according to Whizlabs: "Since there is a mention of only one EC2 instance, placing it behind the ELB 
would not make much sense, hence Options A & B are invalid."
Having it an autoscaling group with just one instnace would not make much sense
Cloudfront distribution would help to alleviate the load in the EC2 instance because of its edge location and cache feature




Question 3: A company is hosting a MySQL database in AWS using the AWS RDS service. To offload the reads, a Read Replica has been created and 
reports are run off the Read Replica database. But at certain times, the reports show stale data. 
What could be the possible reason behind this?

Real Answer: This is due to the replicate lag.

Whizlabs Reasoning: An AWS Whitepaper on the caveat for reading replicas is given below which must be taken into consideration
by architects. Read Replicas are seperate database instance that are replicated asychronously. As a result, they are subject to
replication lag and might be missing sme of the latest transactions. Application architects need to consider which queries
 have the tolerance to slightly state data. These queries can be executed on a Read Replica, while the rest should run on the
 primary node. Read Replicas may also not accept any write queries.


Answer I chose: The backup of the original database has not been set properly.
 My Reasoning: I clearly didn't read this that well. The words "at certain times, the reports show stale data" was a pretty dead
 giveaway. I need to read more carefully. 

Question 6: A company has set up its data layer in the Simple Storage Service. There are a number of requests which include read/write and updates to objects in an S3 bucket. 
Users sometimes complain that updates to an object are not being reflected. What could be the most likely reason for this?
